About the use of rating scale  the author wrote: ""The result of a rating scale experiment is ordinal
data (sets of scores selected from the discrete
rating scale). The means-based ranks and statistical
significance tests that are commonly presented
with the results of RSEs are not generally considered
appropriate for ordinal data in the statistics
literature (Siegel, 1957). At the least, “a test on the
means imposes the requirement that the measures
must be additive, i.e. numerical” (Siegel, 1957, p.
14). Parametric statistics are more powerful than
non-parametric alternatives, because they make a
number of strong assumptions (including that the
data is numerical). If the assumptions are violated
then the risks is that the significance of results is overestimated.""","In the paper are analysed the difference between Rating scale evaluation Vs. Slider scale evaluation. The dimenions od the analysis as the following:

(i) the amount of variation accounted for by differences between systems 
(ii) inter-evaluator agreement
 (iii) evaluator self-consistency
 (iv) the number of significant differences identified

Justified: The authors wrote ""We mostly use parametric statistical
methods in our analysis. It has been debated
for over 50 years whether Likert-type measurement
scales should be analysed using parametric or non-parametric statistical methods (Carifio and
Perla, 2008). The use of parametric statistics, however,
was justified repeatedly by (Carifio and Perla,
2008), (Norman, 2010) and more recently by (Murray,
2013) as a “perfectly appropriate” (Carifio and
Perla, 2008) statistical method for Likert scales that
may be used by researchers “with no fear of coming
to the wrong conclusion” (Norman, 2010). We
therefore present and analyse mean averages (rather
than the mode) for the collected judgements.""","Mean, Standard Deviation",Two-way ANOVA,-,No expert: crowdsourced workers,"Informativeness, Naturalness, Phrasing",-,-,-,-
